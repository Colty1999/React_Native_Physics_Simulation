# React Native Physics Simulation
Project of physical fluid simulation created in React Native

The subject of the engineering diploma thesis is the design of a system enabling the simulation of
the behavior of a liquid stream in two-dimensional space. The obtained results can be used for the
purpose of creating mobile games. The simulation program is written in Javascript. The algorithm was
implemented using the React Native programming platform, which allows you to compile and run
Javascript code on mobile devices with Android and IOS. To test and debug the application, an Android
emulator – Android Studio – was used.
